User Manual 

A .csv file (wind_test.csv) is provided with test data. The file contains 1000 rows and 4 columns, which correspond to:
Col 0 Wind speed (Cartesian coordinates)
Col 1 Wind direction (Cartesian coordinates)
Col 2 Relative Humidity
Col 3 Atmospheric Pressure

This is the input file and the GMM_M4D_separar.py Kmeans_M4D_separar.py codes, the first is used for clustering using GMM and the second makes clustering algorithm using the Kmeans. The output of both is a file of a column with numbers 0-5, which indicates the group to which each data belongs. 
The name of the file is found in the code, so it is not necessary to indicate it in the command line, just run in the terminal
$ python GMM_M4D_separar.py

As a result of this execution, two files will be generated:
1.- clusters_4d_6G.txt
2.- rum2014_g6_states.png

in the case of the code that uses the Kmeans algorithm

The name of the file is also found in the code, so you don't need to indicate it in the command line, just run in the terminal
$ python GMM_M4D_separar.py

As a result of this execution, two files will be generated:
1.- clusters_krum4d_6G.txt
2.- rum2014_g6_states_Kmeans.png
